SUPERFLAT is a de-make of SUPERHOT, made for a UWE Commercial Games Development course one-week game jam. Created by myself and 5 other fellow university Games Technology students, we strove to transform SUPERHOT into an Atari 2600 classic.

This project was created within a group of 5 people and the requirements were to produce a modern game for the Atari 2600.
I was tasked with producing the slow motion effect which changes based on player movement and some UI elements
#### Controls
Movement: WASD keys
Shoot: Spacebar
