#### Ballon Tower Defense
This was made as part of a university module. The goal was to create a Ballon Tower Defense game to showcase my game engine framework built from ground up using DirectX11.

The game currently looks 2D due to the lack of lighting however can support both 2D & 3D.
#### Features
This projects is a working game engine with basic functionality that include: 
1. 3D world space
2. Depth Buffer
3. Working keyboard & mouse input classes
4. Graphics pipeline
5. Pre-set primitive objects that can be called and rendered
6. Placeable towers
7. enemies with varying speed, colours and health
and more.

#### To come
There is more work planned:
1. Lighting
2. Editor/Game mode
3. UI
4. FBX & OBj file support
5. dynamically loadable modules.
