#### To The Core
This project was a collaborative project between me and 3 other team memebers and we were tasked with creating a 3 stage platformer game with each level having a different theme and setting to signfy getting towards a goal.
I was tasked with creating the final level of the game which included a lava shader and particle system, cutscenes & animation, camera control system and the level design of the first area.

1. 3 different levels
2. Collectables

4. NPCs & Enemies 
5. Platformer
6. Objectives
7. Interactable mine-cart system 
and more.
