#### Quality Assurance
Welcome to Artificial Incorporated, a business comprised of you, it's quality assurance worker. You are the only human associate at the company, ensuring the machines upstairs output only quality content.

This project was created within a group of 5 people and the requirements were to make a game sourcing assets from an AI genertation website which takes 2D images and produces an obj file.

1. AI enemies
