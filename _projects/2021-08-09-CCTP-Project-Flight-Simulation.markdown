#### Space Invaders
Made for my final dissertation project for my BSc(hons) Games Technology  
#### Features
This projects includes a tool to create aerodynamic flight properties for different types of aircraft using the unity rigidbody component. 
You can control properties like: 
1. Weight
2. Wing Span
3. Thrust
4. control surfaces
5. Min & Max Deflections
6. Max Torque force
7. control surface rotation speed
8. EngineRPM
and more.
