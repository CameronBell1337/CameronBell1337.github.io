#### What is a game-play Programmer?
A <b>game-play programmer</b> are one team of many others within a Game Studio, they are responsible for the functionality of the game.
Game-play programmers implement the main gameplay within a game from things like the character movement and interaction, in-game entities that require logic.
They must work with scope in mind knowing how hard mechanics can be to design as everyone can have amazing ideas on what they want but in reality getting the
exact outcome while making sure its not too taxing on performance, look, feel and if it can even be possible. 


#### What do companies look for?
 There are many Game Studios which range from large in staff size to small teams of 2 or more. There is quite a lot of competition for the really large companies
 So they are going to be very strick with who they hire. First impressions are everything and the way you make a good first impression is by a good CV. On average employers look at candidates' CV for as little as 10-15 seconds.
 So you really need to make the CV look a part and interesting.
