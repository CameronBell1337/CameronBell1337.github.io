#### What is a game-play Programmer?
A <b>game-play programmer</b> are one team of many others within a Game Studio, they are responsible for the functionality of the game.
Game-play programmers implement the main gameplay within a game from things like the character movement and interaction, in-game entities that require logic.

exact outcome while making sure its not too taxing on performance, look, feel and if it can even be possible.
